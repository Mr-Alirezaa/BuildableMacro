# BuildableMacro

Elevating Swift's Modifier Pattern with Automatic Setter Generation

## Overview

BuildableMacro is a Swift package that leverages the power of macros to enhance Swift types, enabling a SwiftUI-like modifier pattern. It provides a set of macros that automatically generate setter functions for properties, streamlining the process of modifying and chaining property changes.

## Features

- **@Buildable**: Automates the marking of settable properties as @BuildableTracked, excluding those marked as @BuildableIgnored.
- **@BuildableTracked**: Generates setter functions for each marked property, allowing fluent chaining of modifications.
- **@BuildableIgnored**: Excludes properties from automatic setter function generation.

## Usage

Apply the @Buildable macro to a type (class, struct, or actor) to automatically generate fluent setter functions for its properties. Customize the behavior using @BuildableTracked and @BuildableIgnored macros.

## Example

```swift
@Buildable
struct Sample {
    var p1: String
    // Other properties...
}

var sample = Sample(p1: "Initial")
sample = sample
    .p1("Updated")
```

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

BuildableMacro is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). To install
it, simply add the package to the dependencies of your Package.swift file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Mr-Alirezaa/BuildableMacro.git", from: "0.1.0"),
]
```

Normally you'll want to depend on the `BuildableMacro` target:

```swift

```

Or, if you are using Xcode, Click on "File > Add Packages" enter the following URL in the search box. 
then set the version to `from: 0.1.0`.
