BuildableMacro is a Swift package inspired by Apple's [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) and [Observation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation) frameworks, simplifying property modification in Swift through automated fluent setter function generation.

## Overview

BuildableMacro is a Swift package designed to enhance the way properties are modified and managed in Swift. Drawing inspiration from Apple's [Observation framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation), it introduces a set of macros that streamline the property modification process, making it more intuitive and fluent. The package's main feature is its ability to automatically generate setter functions for properties, following a pattern similar to [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui)'s modifier approach.

This approach not only makes the code more readable but also maintains the familiarity for Swift developers accustomed to the [SwiftUI framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui). 

## Features

The package includes `@Buildable`, `@BuildableTracked`, and `@BuildableIgnored` macros, each serving a specific purpose in the property modification workflow. `@BuildableTracked`, for example, creates fluent setter functions, which can be customized with desired names, whereas `@BuildableIgnored` excludes certain properties from this automated process, providing developers with control over their code structure and behavior.

### `@Buildable`

Automates the marking of settable properties as `@BuildableTracked`, excluding those marked as `@BuildableIgnored`.

The `@Buildable` macro selectively applies `@BuildableTracked` to eligible properties. It skips constants, computed properties without setters, and those marked as `@BuildableIgnored`, ensuring only suitable properties are modified.

### `@BuildableTracked`

Generates setter functions for each marked property, allowing fluent chaining of modifications.

In `@BuildableTracked`, a custom name for the generated setter function can be specified through the `name` parameter. This allows for more descriptive and context-specific naming of setter functions, enhancing code clarity and expressiveness.

Although `@BuildableTracked` automatically recognizes function types and adds `@escaping` attribute to the generated functions, the `forceEscaping` parameter ensures correct handling of type aliases for function types. It marks parameters as `@escaping` when needed, ensuring closure and callback patterns are treated accurately, crucial for asynchronous or callback-based code structures.

### `@BuildableIgnored`

Excludes properties from automatic setter function generation.

## Usage

Apply the `@Buildable` macro to a type (class, struct, or actor) to automatically generate fluent setter functions for its properties. Customize the behavior using `@BuildableTracked` and `@BuildableIgnored` macros.

```swift
@Buildable
struct Team {
    @BuildableIgnored
    var name: String
    var nickname: String?
    @BuildableTracked(name: "updateSponsor")
    var sponser: Sponser?
    var owner: Person
    var players: [Person]
    var coach: Person
}

// Old AFC Richmond team:
let afcRichmond = Team(
    name: "AFC Richmond"
    nickname: "The Greyhounds"
    sponser: "Dubai Air"
    owner: Person(name: "Rupert Mannion")
    players: [...]
    coach: Person(name: "George Cartrick")
)

// Change some properties easily by calling generated setter functions to assign new values. (Similar to SwiftUI)
let newAFCRichmond = afcRichmond
    .owner(Person(name: "Rebecca Welton"))
    .coach(Person(name: "Ted Lasso"))
    .updateSponsor(Sponsor(name: "Bantr")) // -> function name is customized by setting`name` property in @BuildableTracked() macro.
    // .name("Crystal Palace") -> This cannot be called since the related property, "name", is ignored and no setter is created for it.
```

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

BuildableMacro is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). To install
it, simply add the package to the dependencies of your Package.swift file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Mr-Alirezaa/BuildableMacro.git", from: "0.2.0"),
]
```

Normally you'll want to depend on the `BuildableMacro` target:

```swift
.product(name: "BuildableMacro", package: "BuildableMacro")
```

Or, if you are using Xcode, Click on "File > Add Packages" enter the following URL in the search box. 
then set the version to `from: 0.2.0`. 

```
https://github.com/Mr-Alirezaa/BuildableMacro.git
```
